\contentsline {table}{\numberline {\relax 8.1}{\ignorespaces Comparing passing rates of CNN at different probabilities versus 75 cm track length cut: Numbers are absolute event counts and Cosmic background is not scaled appropriately. The BNB+Cosmic sample contains all events. The numbers in brackets give the passing rate wrt the step before (first percentage) and wrt the generated events (second percentage). In the BNB+Cosmic MC Truth column shows how many true $\mymath {\@Oldnu }\xspace _{\mymath {\@Oldmu }\xspace }$ CC-inclusive events (in FV) are left in the sample. This number includes possible mis-identifications where a cosmic track is picked by the selection instead of the neutrino interaction in the same event.The CNN MC True generated events were scaled wrt the MC True generated events for the 75 cm cut passing rates due to only running over 188,880 generated events versus the 191362 generated events. The last column Signal:Cosmic only gives an estimate of the $\mymath {\@Oldnu }\xspace _{\mymath {\@Oldmu }\xspace }$ CC events wrt the cosmic only background at each step. For this number, the cosmic background has been scaled as described in \cite {cc-inclusive}. Note that these numbers are not a purity, since other backgrounds canâ€™t be determined at this step.\relax }}{72}{table.caption.60}
