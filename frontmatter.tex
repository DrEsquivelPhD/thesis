  %\thispagestyle{empty}
The purpose of this thesis was to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to separate $\mu'{s}$ and $\pi'{s}$ for use in increasing the acceptance rate of $\mu'{s}$ below the implemented 75cm track length cut in the Charged Current Inclusive (CC-Inclusive) event selection for the CC-Inclusive Cross-Section Measurement. In doing this, we increase acceptance rate for CC-Inclusive events below a specific momentum range.

%% Preface
%\begin{preface}
%  This thesis describes my research on various aspects of the \LHCb
%  particle physics program, centred around the \LHCb detector and \LHC
%  accelerator at \CERN in Geneva.

%  \noindent
%  For this example, I'll just mention \ChapterRef{chap:SomeStuff}
%  and \ChapterRef{chap:MoreStuff}.
